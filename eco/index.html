          <p>
            Remine India is a distinguished startup that focuses on recycling
            electronic waste and lithium batteries, which are some of the most
            hazardous materials that pose a significant environmental threat if
            not disposed of properly. With a strong commitment to sustainability
            and environmental protection, Remine India has developed innovative
            solutions that enable them to safely extract valuable materials from
            e-waste and batteries, thereby reducing their impact on the
            environment.
